# Checkpoint 2 Reflection
## What I Implemented
- **RhymeEngine::setRhymes()** -- This function goes through a Text object and sets the matching rhymes to matching colors
- **RhymeEngine::rhymeStrength** -- helper function, compares ending syllables of words, returns number of matches
- **RhymeEngine::setNewColor** -- helper function, keeps track of what colors have been used, gives new color to new rhyme

## Challenges I Faced
- Not too many, worked basically how I expected.  
- Had to make sure I was passing pointers & references correctly
- There's tons of tiny issues with reading the dictionary & finding rhymes i still need to fix
- Empty lines cause issues, had to remove them
